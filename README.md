## Description:

Welcome to the "Deep Learning Projects" repository - a carefully selected collection of projects that showcase the practical implementation of neural networks using the R programming language. This repository offers a valuable resource to anyone interested in deep learning, regardless of your level of expertise. You'll find various projects covering various domains, providing insights and practical guidance to help you enhance your understanding and proficiency in utilizing the power of neural networks with R.

## Project Topics:

***Perceptron and Gradient descent***: This project uses training and test data to explore classifiers for a simulated binary classification problem. It involves visualizing the training data to identify linear separability and estimating a decision boundary. Next, the perceptron algorithm is executed and evaluated for convergence and error rates. Finally, the classifier with superior performance on the test data is identified, providing insights into its efficacy. The project involves fitting a linear regression model using R and obtaining estimated regression coefficients. This includes minimizing the sum of squared residuals and implementing a gradient-descent algorithm to obtain the least-squares estimates.

***Deep neural network for Regression***: This project involves constructing and comparing regression models across different paradigms. First, a linear regression model is fitted conventionally, and the test Mean Squared Error (MSE) is obtained through Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV). Subsequently, the same linear model is implemented as a shallow learning model in a deep learning framework. The process is repeated for logistic regression for another dataset, where estimates and 5-fold Cross-Validation (CV) test errors are determined both conventionally and in a shallow learning context. Finally, a multinomial regression model is constructed for different datasets using the usual method and as a shallow learning model. Through this comprehensive analysis, the project aims to deepen understanding and proficiency in other regression modeling techniques, showcasing the versatility and comparative effectiveness of conventional and deep learning approaches.

***Auotoencoders and Recomenders System***: This project centers around latent semantic analysis applied to a dataset featuring 102 news stories from the New York Times. An initial assessment evaluates the total number of Principal Components (PCs) in the dataset. Moving forward, a feedforward neural network model, specifically a linear autoencoder with a hidden layer comprising two nodes, is fitted to the data. Finally, a comparison is made between the scores derived from the first two PCs and the activations of the hidden layer. The overarching goal of the project is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between the data and the models employed, shedding light on the efficacy of dimensionality reduction and autoencoding techniques in capturing relevant features. The next project involves building a movie recommender system using autoencoders for the MovieLens (100k) dataset in R. With 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1664 movies, the primary challenge is handling the majority of missing entries in the dataset. The process includes data exploration, preprocessing, and the implementation of an autoencoder architecture for collaborative filtering. The trained autoencoder is then utilized to predict missing ratings and generate personalized movie recommendations for users. 

***Regularization Techniques*** This project aims to explore the practical use of regularization techniques in machine learning, with a focus on how they can be used to minimize overfitting and improve model generalization. By varying different tuning parameters and analyzing the resulting validation errors, the project aims to identify the most effective regularization strengths. The findings will provide valuable insights into how regularization influences model complexity and the significant role it plays in improving the robustness of machine learning models.

***Convolutional Neural Network*** The project aims to construct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models with different architectures, tuning essential parameters, and assessing model accuracy through error rate analysis. By experimenting with diverse configurations, the project seeks to identify the optimal combination of activation functions and layer structures that yield the highest accuracy. Pretrained models will be leveraged to enhance the efficiency and applicability of the CNNs. The documentation will provide a comprehensive overview of the project's outcomes and implications for CNN-based image classification tasks.

***Recurrent Neural Network*** This project centers on constructing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the objective of achieving higher test accuracy through parameter tuning. The primary focus involves experimenting with various architectural configurations, activation functions, and other hyperparameters to optimize the RNN model. By systematically adjusting these tuning parameters, the project aims to enhance the model's predictive capabilities on the test set.
